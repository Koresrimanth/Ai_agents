HOW THE E2E TESTING AGENT WORKS:

1. You input test instructions in natural language.
2. The agent uses LangChain + LangGraph to:
   - Interpret the instruction.
   - Generate Playwright test scripts.
   - Execute them in a headless browser.
   - Validate success with assertions.
3. Tools like Wikipedia or Weather APIs can be used to enrich test cases.
4. A local Flask app is used to mock a web page for the test.

Example:
"Open the registration page and check if the submit button exists."
=> The agent writes and runs this test automatically.
